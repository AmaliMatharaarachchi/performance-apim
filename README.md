# Artifacts for WSO2 API Manager Performance Tests

This repository has artifacts to be used for WSO2 API Manager Performance Tests.

The [distribution](distribution) directory has the scripts and the Maven project to build the final distribution package
 to be used for performance tests.

The package (**performance-apim-distribution-${version}.tar.gz**) built by the distribution maven module is the
 package required for API Manager performance tests from this repository.

The (**performance-common-distribution-${version}.tar.gz**) package is also required for performance tests and the
 scripts in this repository depend on the scripts in "performance-common" package.

**Note:** The scripts are only compatible with **WSO2 API Manager 2.1.0**.

Following is the recommended deployment for performance testing All-in-one WSO2 API Manager.

## Package contents

Following is the tree view of the contents inside distribution package.

```
|-- apim
|   |-- apim-start.sh
|   |-- conf
|   |   |-- api-manager.xml
|   |   |-- datasources
|   |   |   `-- master-datasources.xml

`-- jmeter
    |-- apim-test.jmx
    |-- create-summary-csv.sh
    `-- run-performance-test.sh
```

Each directory has executable scripts.

This package must be extracted in user home directory of all JMeter servers and the API Manager server used for the 
 performance tests.

**Note:** These scripts will work only on Debian based systems like Ubuntu.

See following sections for more details.

### WSO2 API Manager

The "apim" directory has the scripts related to WSO2 API Manager and the configurations. These scripts must be run in
 WSO2 API Manager instance.

Following sections have more details about each script.

### setup.sh

The `setup.sh` script is the only script you need to run to set up and configure WSO2 API Manager.

This script extracts WSO2 API Manager to user home directory, configures it, creates APIs, and generates the required
 OAuth2 access tokens for the created APIs.

This script invokes `configure.sh`, `apim-start.sh`, `create-apis.sh`, and `generate-tokens.sh` scripts.

How to run:

`./setup.sh netty_host mysql_host mysql_user mysql_password mysql_connector_jar`

Latest MySQL connector must be downloaded.

### configure.sh

The `configure.sh` script creates the databases (for API Manager, Registry, and User store) in MySQL server and
 copies the configurations.

The pre-configured configuration files are inside `conf` directory and the script changes those configurations to use
 the given MySQL server.

How to run:

`./configure.sh mysql_host mysql_user mysql_pw mysql_connector_jar`

**Note:** This script is called from `setup.sh`.

#### apim-start.sh

This script starts the WSO2 API Manager with the given Java heap size and enable Garbage Collection (GC) logs in the
 server.

How to run:

`./apim-start.sh 4`

Above example will start the API Manager with 4GB of heap.

**Note:** This script is called from `setup.sh` and the performance test script.

#### create-apis.sh

This script creates two APIs.

1. Echo API: This is a direct proxy
2. Mediation API: This has an "OUT" sequence with JSON to JSON Payload Factory mediator). The sequence depends on the
 payloads generated by the `generate-payloads.sh` script in `performance-common` package.

How to run:

`./create-apis.sh apim_host netty_host`

**Note:** This script is called from `setup.sh`.

### generate-tokens.sh

This script generates tokens to be used by the performance testing script. Two files will be created in the `target`
 directory.

1. tokens.sql: This SQL file is used to insert tokens to the MySQL table. The `setup.sh` uses this SQL file and executes
 the sql file in API Manager MySQL database.
2. tokens.csv: This file has all tokens and this file must be copied to the user home directory of all JMeter servers.

How to run:

`./generate-tokens.sh tokens_count`

**Note:** This script is called from `setup.sh`.

### Apache JMeter

Inside "jmeter", directory there are two scripts to run the performance tests and create a summary CSV from the JMeter
 results.

#### run-performance-test.sh

The `run-performance-test.sh` script runs the performance tests for different test scenarios. This script must be used
 in the JMeter client instance and it uses the two JMeter servers to load test WSO2 API Manager

This script is using ssh config to connect with other servers from JMeter client and get server metrics and log files.
 Therefore, it is important use a configuration as follows in `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host apimjmeter1
    HostName x.x.x.1
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/keys/apim.pem

Host apimjmeter2
    HostName x.x.x.2
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/keys/apim.pem

Host apim
    HostName x.x.x.3
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/keys/apim.pem

Host apimnetty
    HostName x.x.x.4
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/keys/apim.pem
```

There are multiple parameters inside the script and the values should be changed as required.

 Parameter | Description
------------ | -------------
concurrent_users | The different number of concurrent users. This an array and the brackets are important.
backend_sleep_time | The different backend sleep times in milliseconds. This is an array.
message_size | The different number of message sizes (payloads) in Bytes. This is an array.
api_host | The API Manager hostname or IP
api_path | The path of the API to test
api_ssh_host | The ssh host for the API Manager server
backend_ssh_host | The ssh host for the server with Netty HTTP Echo Service
test_duration | Duration of the test in seconds.
warmup_time | The warmup time in minutes. This is used for JTL Splitter, which is from `performance-common`
jmeter1_host | The hostname or IP of the JMeter Server 01
jmeter2_host | The hostname or IP of the JMeter Server 02
jmeter1_ssh_host | The ssh host for the JMeter Server 01
jmeter2_ssh_host | The ssh host for the JMeter Server 02
apim_heap_size | Heap Size in GBs

After changing parameters, the performance tests can be started from the script in the JMeter Client server as shown in
 above diagram. It's recommended to run the tests in `nohup` mode.

For example:

`nohup ./run-performance-test.sh > test.out 2>&1 &`

The results of performance tests will be saved in `results` directory.

**Note:** Please make sure Java, JMeter and SAR are installed using the scripts provided in `performance-commmon`
 package.

#### create-summary-csv.sh

After the performance tests are completed, a summary CSV for all results can be created using this script file.

The script expects the [GCViewer](https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer) jar file to analyze GC logs. The latest
 GCViewer JAR file can be downloaded from [Maven](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/chewiebug/gcviewer/)

The script must be run inside the results directory.

How to run:

`~/jmeter/create-summary-csv.sh /path/to/gcviewer*.jar`
